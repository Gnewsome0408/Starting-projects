    <h1>USing CSS to expand your webpage</h1>
         <p> CSS provides your HTML with the design elements that make it appealing to an audience. For example, colour and spacing can be applied through these CSS definitions.

    <h2>Summary: CSS introduction</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look</li> 
                <li>Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like.</li>
                <li>Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elemetns.</li>
                <li>Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the elements that you want to change, and the values of those properties.</li>
                <li>CSS rules usually appear in a seperate document, although tehy mauy appear within an HTML page.</li>
            </ol>

     <h2>Summary: Using Colour in CSS</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Colour not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.</li> 
                <li>There are three ways to specify colours in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and colour names.</li>
                <li>Colour pickers can help you find the colour you want.</li>
                <li>It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background colour.</li>
                <li>CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colours to indicate opacity. Known as RGBA.</li>
                <li>CSS3 also allows you to specify colours as HSL values, with an optional opacity value know as HSLA.</li>
            </ol>
